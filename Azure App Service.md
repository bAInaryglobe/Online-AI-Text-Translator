# What is Azure Apps Service?
From your source code to worldwide availability, Azure Apps addresses the difficult difficulties. While you concentrate on designing your project, Azure Apps creates and hosts it using GitHub or Azure DevOps.

Azure App Service is a fully-managed platform by Microsoft that simplifies web app deployment and management. It supports multiple programming languages, offers automatic scaling for high traffic, and integrates smoothly with other Azure services. With easy deployment, continuous integration, and robust security features, developers can focus on creating exceptional web experiences while Azure takes care of the infrastructure and maintenance aspects. It's a launchpad for developers to bring their web projects to life with speed, reliability, and scalabilityâ€”all in one place! ðŸš€
The **Azure Apps or Azure Static Web App** approach is that you get exactly what you need, nothing more, nothing less.

Azure App Service is like having your own personal launchpad for your web projects. It's a fully-managed platform provided by Microsoft that takes care of all the complex stuff, so you can focus on creating amazing experiences for your users.

## Here's what makes Azure App Service so awesome:

### Easy Deployment
It's as simple as uploading your web code or connecting it to a code repository like GitHub. No need to worry about server configurations or network settings. Just click a few buttons, and your app will be up and running in no time!

### Scalability 
Imagine your app goes viral, and thousands (or millions!) of users want to access it simultaneously. Azure App Service can handle the traffic spikes effortlessly. It automatically scales up or down based on demand, ensuring a smooth user experience for everyone.

### Supported Languages
Whether you love coding in C#, Java, Python, Node.js, or PHP, Azure App Service has got you covered. You can write your app in the language you're most comfortable with.

### Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)
This cool feature lets you automatically deploy your code changes whenever you push to your repository. It saves you time and reduces the risk of human errors during deployment.

### Security & Compliance
Azure takes security very seriously. It provides robust security features and compliance certifications, ensuring that your app and your users' data stay safe and protected.

### Integration with Other Azure Services
You can easily connect your app to other awesome Azure services like databases, storage, authentication, and more. It's like building a dream team of services to enhance your app's capabilities.

## Create the Azure App
You're a web developer who has developed a web app. A web app is often composed of HTML, JavaScript, or CSS files and can be developed manuallyÂ or by using a framework.

Before you can deploy the app to Azure, you need to build it.

- Create a repository for your app on GitHub.
- Run the app locally and view it via a browser.

With the copy created locally, youâ€™re all set to start working on your code and site. Now youâ€™ll explore how to deploy your site to the cloud. Youâ€™ll use Azure Apps to host your site. Using Azure Apps Service will allow you to quickly post your web site to the world.
